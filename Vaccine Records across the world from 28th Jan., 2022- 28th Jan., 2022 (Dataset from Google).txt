Data Importation:

* create table geo_map
(
country varchar(100),
vaccine numeric);

copy public.geo_map from 'C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\geoMap.csv' DELIMITER ',' csv HEADER;


Questions I was curiously queried the dataset on:

1. What are the top 10 countries in the world with the highest 
Covid-19 vaccine exercise between Jan 2021 and Jan 2022?

 * select distinct country, max(vaccine) as "Number of Covid-19 Vaccines Adminstered"
from geo_map
where vaccine is not null
group by distinct country
order by max(vaccine) desc
limit 10

2. What are the top 3 countries with the least vaccine exercise?

* select distinct country, min(vaccine) 
as "Number of Vaccines Administered between Jan, 2021 and Jan, 2022" 
from geo_map 
where vaccine is not null
group by distinct country 
order by min(vaccine) asc
limit 3


3. How many vaccine doses have been administered between the date range?

*select sum (vaccine) 
as "Total Doeses Aminstered in the world between Jan., 2021-Jan, 2022" 
from geo_map

4. Which countries didn't have any vaccine record? Why? was it due to lack if resources to the vaccines 
	or simply because they had no COVID record in the country?

* select distinct country, coalesce (vaccine, 0) "Number of Vaccines Administered"
from geo_map where vaccine is null 
order by country 
--I ran some google research and found that most of the coutries had no record mostly due to vaccine shortage than 
  due to lack of Covid-19 occurence

5. In a sentence, state the country and the number of vaccines that were adminstered within given the date range

* select country || ' had ' || vaccine || 
' records of Covid-19 vaccines'
as "World Record of Covid-19 Vaccines between Jan 2021 and Jan 2022"
from geo_map
where vaccine is not null
order by country, vaccine desc
